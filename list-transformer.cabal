synopsis:            List monad transformer
description:         This library provides a list monad transformer that
                     enriches lists with effects.  This type obeys all the
                     relevant laws (including the monad laws, unlike
                     "Control.Monad.Trans.List") and streams efficiently in
                     constant space.
                     .
                     This library also has an extensive tutorial in the
                     "List.Transformer" module which explains the motivation
                     behind this type and how to use the type fluently.
                     .
                     This is similar to the @list-t@ library except making a few
                     different design decisions, such as:
                     .
                     * a smaller dependency graph
                     .
                     * no new type classes
                     .
                     * some different instances
                     .
                     * no utilities that buffer list elements
